Idea of this application is to create as much Google+ application alike plussers edition
for Facebook news feed as possible. I'm totally stealing ideas from Google+ application to
the best extent I can think of.

You will need to download Facebook Android SDK and import it to Eclipse. Once you have imported
the SDK project add it as a reference library for fPlus project.
